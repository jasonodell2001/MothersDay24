<p>Happy Mother's Day! </p>
<p>Dear Mom, <br> I didn't have any money to get you a gift this year so I figured I would try and put my education to use in some capacity. <br>
I love you so much and I cannot thank you enough for all you do and have done for me over the past 23 years of my life. <br>
    From the big things to even the small things like saying how much you love my laugh or how much you love my friends, it means the world to me. <br>
    I could not ask for a better Mom & only wish you thought as highly of yourself as I do of you <br>
    Happy Mother's Day! <br>
    Love, <br>
    Your favorite Son, <br>
    Jason <BR>
    PS: I'm sorry, I couldn't make you some fabulous website or a cool application, I only came up with this idea on thursday
